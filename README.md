## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
2. JavaScript dynamically loops through the `kdramas` array.  
3. For each K-Drama:
   - A card element is created.  
   - A random emoji is assigned.  
   - All details are displayed inside the card.  
4. The total drama count is automatically updated.
